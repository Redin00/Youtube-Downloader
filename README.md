## Youtube Downloader (Python)

Script in python whose goal is to let you download Youtube videos, with the integration of a simple GUI made with the library TKInter and [ttkbootstrap](https://github.com/israel-dryer/ttkbootstrap/).
<br>The download of YT videos is made with the external library `"yt-dlp"` available on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/yt-dlp/
<br>
<br>
### IMPORTANT!
To execute the script manually you need ffmpeg binary in the same file directory. You can download it here: https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds/wiki/Latest. When you download the ffmpeg build, extract the compressed file and search for the main binary called ffmpeg (ffmpeg.exe for windows), and finally move it to the script's folder.
<br><br>I compiled the script in a single file using Pyinstaller, but if u want to do it yourself for security reasons, the source code is available, and I suggests you to read the [COMPILEGUIDE.md](COMPILEGUIDE.md)
