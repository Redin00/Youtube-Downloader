## Youtube Downloader (Python)

Script in python whose goal is to let you download Youtube videos, with the integration of a simple GUI made with the library TKInter.
<br>The download of YT videos is made with the external library "yt-dlp" available on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/yt-dlp/
<br><br> IMPORTANT! To execute the script you need ffmpeg.exe in the same file directory. You can download it here: https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds/wiki/Latest (For windows, win64-gpl is recommended)
<br><br>I compiled the script in a single .exe file using Pyinstaller, but if u want to do it yourself for security reasons, the source code is available, and I suggests you to read the [COMPILEGUIDE.md](COMPILEGUIDE.md)
